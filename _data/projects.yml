    title: A Few-Shot Learning for Animation Character Classification
    summary: Software Capstone Project
    description: Few-shot classification is a problem of recognizing unseen classes during training with limited labeled examples. While meta-learning algorithms became one promising direction, our experiment shows that these algorithms work poorly on animated character datasets compared to real-world image datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose two approaches, 1) introducing triple loss (or quadruple loss) to the existing algorithms, and 2) converting features to be more task-relevant using learnable mapping function.

    title: Positive and Negative Training of Graph Convolutional Network
    summary: Software Capstone Project
    description: Graph convolutional network (GCN) is a class of convolutional network that can process data that can be represented by graph. Utilizing that the concept of negativity is clear on graph, we propose the training paradigm that considering both positive graph and negative graph where negative graph can be defined various way, e.g., shortest path, random drop. The experiment shows that applying this training to GCN models (e.g., GraphSAGE, GAT, SplinCNN) can outperform the existing accuracy.
